Collecting Meshes
Some meshes were statically batched. These meshes can not be used for navmesh calculation due to technical constraints.
During runtime scripts cannot access the data of meshes which have been statically batched.
One way to solve this problem is to use cached startup (Save & Load tab in the inspector) to only calculate the graph when the game is not playing.
